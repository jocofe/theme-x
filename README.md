# Theme X – Shopify Theme from Scratch

This is a personal project to build a fully custom Shopify theme **from scratch**, without using any existing base like Dawn. The goal is to deeply understand the inner workings of Shopify themes and improve my skills in:

- Liquid
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- Theme architecture
- Shopify CLI workflow

## 👨‍💻 Why this project?

I'm a front-end developer and UX/UI designer working at **Onestic**, a tech company focused on ecommerce solutions. In my day-to-day work, I use a custom Shopify theme (based on Dawn), but I wanted to **start from zero** to truly learn how themes are built and how everything connects inside Shopify.

## 🧱 What I'm building

A custom Shopify theme called **Theme X**, with no external code. Just me, Liquid, and code I fully understand and write from scratch.

This theme will eventually support:

- Dynamic sections
- Product pages with variant logic
- Collection filtering
- Interactive components with JavaScript
- Fully responsive layout
- Clean, scalable architecture

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Shopify Liquid
- HTML5
- CSS (no framework for now)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Shopify CLI for local development
